**Design, build, and test OpenSCAD programs to bring your ideas to life using 3D printers**

## What is this book about?
OpenSCAD is an open-source 3D design platform that helps you bring your designs to life. This book will show you how to make the best use of OpenSCAD to design and build objects using 3D printers.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Gain a solid understanding of 3D printers and 3D design requirements to start creating your own objects
* Prepare a 3D printer for a job starting from leveling the print bed and loading the filament
* Discover various OpenSCAD commands and use them to create shapes
* Understand how OpenSCAD compares to other CAD programs
* Get to grips with combining text and a cube to create an object

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
$fn=50;
union()
{
    square(10, center = true);
    circle(d=11);
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for engineers, hobbyists, teachers, 3D printing enthusiasts, and individuals working in the field of 3D printing. Basic knowledge of setting up and running 3D printers is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).

## Get to Know the Author
**Colin Dow**
has been 3D printing since 2013 starting with the laser cut wooden frame version of the Ultimaker 3D printer. He has gone through a dozen or so 3D printers over the years from MakerBots, PrintrBots, early Prusa i3s, delta printers, and liquid resin printers. Colin has been working with OpenSCAD since 2014 using it with 3D printers to design and manufacture model rocketry parts for his model rocketry business. Through his aerospace workshops he has introduced many students to 3D printing including in-class demonstrations of 3D printing. Over the last few years Colin has been designing and building automated drones for his drone startup using 3D printers and OpenSCAD.
